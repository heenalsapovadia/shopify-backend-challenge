# shopify-backend-challenge
TASK: Build an inventory tracking web application for a logistics company. We are looking for a web application that meets the requirements listed below, along with one additional feature, with the options also listed below.

## Tech Stack:
Backend : `Node.js`, `Express.js`
Frontend : `React.js`

## Folder Structure Instructions:
1. `shopify-backend` : contains all the code for backend of the application
2. `inventory-frontend` : contains all the code for the frontend of the application

## Project Execution Instructions:
1. Clone/download the repository
2. Dependencies required : `nodeJS`
  - You can download the relevant nodeJS installer [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. Open command prompt in the downloaded repo and enter the following commands :
 1. `cd shopify-backend` : this will take you inside the backend code folder
 2. `npm install` : this will download and install all the dependencies required to run the project
 3. `npm start` : this will start your backend server on PORT 8080
 4. `cd ..` : Go one directory backwards
 5. `cd inventory-frontend` : this will take you to the frontend code
 6. `npm install` : Again, this downloads and installs the dependencies required for the frontend
 7. `npm start` : This starts the server for the frontend code on PORT 3000
4. At the end of all the above steps, you should be able to access the application at the following URL : `http://localhost:3000`
